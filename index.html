Cartography is the practice of making and using maps. In this subject I was able to learn professional mapmaking skills to design different maps using a range of spatial data. The course advanced my skills in adobe illustrator and enhanced my knowledge of the spatial data that is widely available in Victoria. Furthermore, through practical learning I developed my understanding on concepts including cartographic design principles, graphic layout and typography for maps. Two maps which I created for this subject are listed below, and images of each map are below.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

	<div class="bar"><h2>Cadastral Survey Practice & Law</h2></div> <!-- #ID# #SUBJECT# Change the text to fit a subject you have done yourself-->
	<div class="paragraphs">
	  Cadastral Surveying Practice and Cadastral Surveying Law are two subjects that covered the important concepts related to cadastral surveying. Through studying these subjects I learnt about the history and evolution of Victoria's Land Tenure System and the application of the Property Law Act 1958 in relation to Crown boundaries. These subjects provided me with a good foundation of knowledge and skills which I can apply in the future if I wish to become a registered Licensed Surveyor. I was able to develop my practical skills through the process of completing urban and rural re-establishment plans as well as Plan for Subdivision. Below are three images which consist of a Plan of Subdivision, an urban Re-establishment Plan, and a rural Re-Establishment Plan. These plans were completed using intricate calculations based on survey data, and AutoCad. &nbsp;

	My time at Chris Smith and Associates has consisted of working with senior experienced surveyors and learning about the required skills and methods used on a daily basis in the field and in the office. I have had the opportunity to improve my skills with using intricate surveying technology including Trimble total stations and GNSS, and Leica total stations and digital level. Working closely with surveyors in a business which also has engineers and planners, I have been able to see how projects come together from all aspects. 
		<p>
		As part of the surveying team, I have been able to experience working alongside experienced surveyors to complete the fieldwork required for cadastral surveys, feature surveys, and building surveys. Through first-hand experience I have been able to develop my skills with Trimble and Leica instruments to gather the necessary survey data required to meet project specifications, ensuring accuracy, precision, and timely completion of all surveying tasks. Along with the methods used in the field, I have been able to develop my skills using software to process survey data and create survey plans. AutoCad and Liscad are the two main software packages which I have been able to practice using during my time at Chris Smith and Associates. Overall, my experience with this company has had a significant positive impact on my knowledge of the skills and methods required in the profession of a surveyor both out in the field, and in the office.
